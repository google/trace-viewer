#summary Contributing to trace-viewer

=Basics=
1. [http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools Install the depot tools]

2. Get the source with git svn
{{{
git svn clone https://trace-viewer.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ trace-viewer
}}}

3. Make a branch. Folks used to Android-style repo/gerrit should note that this project's review system (git cl + rietveld) uses 1 codereview per branch. Your branch's commits are squashed on upload.
{{{
git checkout -t -b mybranch git-svn
}}}

4a. Set up a local http server, from the main trace-viewer directory:
{{{
./run_dev_server.py
}}}
You can then run any of _test.html by browsing to http://localhost:8003/src/.

4b. Iteratively:
{{{
... make changes
... verify changes by running http://localhost:8001/src/tests.html
git commit -a -m "My change"
git cl upload
}}}

4c. If you need to update your code, foreach branch you need to update:
{{{
git svn rebase
}}}

5. When you've gotten LGTM
{{{
git cl dcommit
}}}
If you are prompted for a username/password, use your googlecode password from [https://code.google.com/hosting/settings here].

6. If you need your change to appear in Chrome, remind one of the project OWNERs to rev the downstream DEPS 


=Some notes=

* Testing full files against importer changes: put a file into test_data/, then edit and run src/interactive_tests.html. 

* Chromium: If you are editing tracing from the chrome repo, add the following lines to your trace-viewer .gitconfig:
{{{
[svn-remote "svn"]
        url = https://trace-viewer.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
        fetch = :refs/remotes/git-svn
}}}
