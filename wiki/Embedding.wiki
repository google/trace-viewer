#summary Making standalone HTML files

If you have a trace file that you want to turn into a html file with a viewer then:


sys.path.append(path_to_trace_viewer_repo)
from trace_viewer.build import trace2html
with open('my_trace.html', 'w') as new_file:
   trace2html.WriteHTMLForTracesToFile(['my_trace.json'], new_file)

This will produce a standalone trace viewer with my_trace packed inside.

Embedding trace-viewer as your own polymer component is WIP. It'll happen soon.

# Embedding Trace Viewer
We are working on making trace-viewer an embeddable polymer component. Its not quite there yet.
