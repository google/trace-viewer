/**
 * @fileoverview TimelineModel is a parsed representation of the
 * TraceEvents obtained from base/trace_event in which the begin-end
 * tokens are converted into a hierarchy of processes, threads,
 * subrows, and slices.
 *
 * The building block of the model is a slice. A slice is roughly
 * equivalent to function call executing on a specific thread. As a
 * result, slices may have one or more subslices.
 *
 * A thread contains one or more subrows of slices. Row 0 corresponds to
 * the "root" slices, e.g. the topmost slices. Row 1 contains slices that
 * are nested 1 deep in the stack, and so on. We use these subrows to draw
 * nesting tasks.
