Description:
  This project is the python equivalent of google-gflags, a Google commandline
  flag implementation for C++. It is intended to be used in situations where a
  project wants to mimic the command-line flag handling of a C++ app that uses
  google-gflags, or for a Python app that, via swig or some other means, is
  linked with a C++ app that uses google-gflags.

  The gflags package contains a library that implements commandline flags
  processing. As such it's a replacement for getopt(). It has increased
  flexibility, including built-in support for Python types, and the ability to
  define flags in the source file in which they're used. (This last is its
  major difference from OptParse.)
