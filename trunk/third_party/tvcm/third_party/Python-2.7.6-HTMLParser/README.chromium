Description:
A subsettted python 2.7.6 distribution.

Local Modifications:
Python revs != 2.7.6 ship with a rather broken HTMLParser module that
doesn't properly handle cdata sections, and doesn't handle malformed
start tags. This directory brings in Python 2.7.6's HTMLParser file so that we
can use the "standard" parser.
